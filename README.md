## How to set up the project

    git clone https://github.com/Divyansh72144/Coffee_Book_Task.git
    npm install
    npm start

## How to run tests

    npm run test:backend

## Features

- Es lint addition for fixing syntax errors, code styles and removing unnecessary code

* Search Feature on the frontend based on name,weight,price and roast level as well as backend for name

Example of list search in backend

## Notes

I've already built build folder from my Coffee_frontend and serving that build folder to my backend

I have uploaded .env files, So that the project can be cloned and ran by the tester. I am well aware that .env file shouldn't be uploaded/pushed to github for security reasons.
